            <P>
                My name is Johnathan Hoyt and this is my coding journey so far. Before starting my time at Lambda School, my coding knowledge was entirely self taught.
                I had gone to sites like codecademy, and even bought myself a "Coding for Dummies" book. I had endeavored to teach myself as much as possible through these
                resources. This went well...for a time. I went through HTML and CSS with ease and learned as much JavaScript as possible. I started getting out of my depth 
                with self-teaching when I started getting into React.js and this is when I decided that I needed a more structured education. I had gone through almost 3
                years before I finally came across Lambda School, and found that this was my chance to get that structured education that would give me the chance to learn
                and gain the skills needed for this field. Thus began my journey through Lambda....
