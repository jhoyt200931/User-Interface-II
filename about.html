            Hello everyone! Let me tell you a little about myself:
        </span>
        <p>
            My name is Johnathan Hoyt. I was born on May 19th, 1996 and I'm about to turn 24 years old. I grew up in a small town in New York called Hannibal. 
            I went through my entire school career in Hannibal and played several sports for their teams. My favorites were baseball and football, as they still
            are today. Up until a few years ago, I had no idea what I wanted to do in life. I was sitting at work one day answering calls in my call center when 
            it finally dawned on me that this is not what I had envisioned for myself. So I sat down and assessed myself, thinking what I really had a passion for
            and what skills were currently in demand. After thinking for a while, I came to the conclusion that I liked to make things, as well as get under the 
            hood and see how things worked, and I have a real passion for technology. With that being the case, I turned my attention towards technology related 
            fields and found the world of coding. It really sparked my interest and I found myself wanting to learn all about this world. I purchased a "Coding for Dummies"
            book and started teaching myself how to code. I had learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by the time I felt like I was getting out of my depth with self
            education. I them decided to turn towards professional sources, thus began my coding journey at Lambda School!

        </ul>
        <p>Thank you! This was just a little bit about me and how I arrived at the decision to dedicate my life to becoming a software engineer, and being the best that I can be. I hope you enjoyed!</p>
